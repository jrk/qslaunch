Simple example.

This script can only do one thing: start a new iTerm window with
a local shell in it, based on the profile "A Local Shell".

If the profile doesn't exist, iTerm will use the default profile.

To use from Quicksilver, simply copy in a directory registered in its
catalog, and refresh the catalog (or restart QS).

Make sure the script is executable!
