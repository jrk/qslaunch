Sample qslaunch script based on the *program name*.

Setup
-----

For example, lets assume you have a directory `~/quicksilver_commands`
and this script exists as `~/qs_iterm_launcher.py` and id executable.

cd-ing to `~/quicksilver_commands` and typing:

.. code-block:: console

    ln ~/qs_iterm_launcher.py something

will create a hardlink to this script. The "program name", when
executed, will be "something".

Lets also assume you have registered `~/quicksilver_commands` in
Quicksilver's custom catalog...

Bringing Quicksilver's window and typing "something" should find
the "something" in "~/quicksilver_commands".

Executing the "Run" action on this will execute the script with
"something" as the program name.

.. note::

    files ending with ".com" and ".net" don't seem to get executed.
    
    Simply adding ".py" will correct the problem.


Rule explanation
----------------

If "something" is "local", this will open up a new iTerm *tab*
based on the bookmark named "A Local Shell". If that bookmark
doesn't actually exist in iTerm, iTerm will use the *default*
bookmark.

If "something" is "local-finder", this will also cd to the
front most Finder window's path.

If "something" is "gnuplot", it'll open a new *window*, then
start "gnuplot" in it (assuming it's installed on your system).

If "something" is "s-myserver", it'll open a new *tab* and start
an ssh session to "myserver.example.org".

If "something" is "sdfdf", it'll pop an error using growl,
if growl's python bindings are installed.
