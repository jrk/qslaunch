sample_arg
~~~~~~~~~~

Sample qslaunch script based on the first argument.

This script could be copied to:

    ``~/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/Actions``

and be made executable. Then if you restart Quicksilver, you'll have a new
action named "sample_arg".

If you bring up Quicksilver's window and type something, and then
select the action "sample_arg", it'll run this script.

Or you might simply type in a shell:

.. code-block:: console
    
    ./sample_arg.py something

If "something" is "local", this will open up a new iTerm *tab*
based on the bookmark named "A Local Shell". If that bookmark
doesn't actually exist in iTerm, iTerm will use the *default*
bookmark.

If "something" is "local-finder", this will also cd to the
front most Finder window's path.

If "something" is "gnuplot", it'll open a new *window*, then
start "gnuplot" in it (assuming it's installed on your system).

If "something" is "s-myserver", it'll open a new *tab* and start
an ssh session to "myserver.example.org".

If "something" is "sdfdf", it'll pop an error using growl,
if growl's python bindings are installed.
